## About this project
This is a project that implements the web application as a shopping platform using **SpringBoot**, **MySQL** and **jQuery**. (For all frameworks I used, please check out the [pom.xml](https://github.com/traveleryyk1999/Campus-Shopping-Platform/blob/main/pom.xml))

## Structure
This project uses Spring MVC structure basically. Model corresponds to the files under the **entity** folder, View and Controller correspond to the files under the **web** folder.

## Properties
The database's properties are saved under src/main/resources. Specifics about redis and log are both saved under the resources folder.

## Note
This project has initially been linked to an official account on WeChat. Be sure to check out the **wechat** folder and the [official doc](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/) before starting to use related services.:cowboy_hat_face:
